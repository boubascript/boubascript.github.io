# Discrete Structures (CSCI 150 @ Hunter with Schaffer)
**SF** = **Schaffer Formula** = Formulas Highlighted in blue in the text = *Memorize them*

* ## Basic Sum Manipulations

  * Item 3-4: Adding integers from 1 to n-1

* ## Sum Manipulations with Arithmetic Series
  * Item 5: Introducing Arithmetic Series, Sigma Notation
    * **Schaffer Formula #1 (sum of first n numbers = n(n+1)/2 )**
  * Item 6: Sigma Manipulations

* ## Set Theory 
  * Item 7: Introducing Set Theory
    * Choose Notation
    * 0, 1, 2 element subsets 

* ## Binomial Theorem
  * Item 8: Coefficients of terms with 0,1,2 y's
  * Item 9: Binomial Coefficients
    * **Schaffer Formula #2( nCk = nCn-k )**
    * **SF#3( Binomial Theorem )**
  
* ## Multiplication Principle
  * Item 10: Introducing Multiplication Principle
  * Item 11: Number of terms in a binomial expansion (with subscripts)
  * Item 12: **SF#4( sum nCi = 2^n )**
  * Item 13: Total number of elements in an n element set
  
* ## Factorial Manipulation
  * Item 14: Number of orderings; Introducing permutations, factorial notation
  * Item 15: Factorial Manipulation (canceling factors in numerator/denominator)
  * Item 16: Ordering k elements of an n element set ( n!/(n-k)! )
  * Item 17: Choosing k element subsets of an n element set
    * **SF#5( nCk = n! / k!(n-k! )**
  * Item 18: Calculating Binomial Coefficients using SF5
  
* Item 19: Representing numbers in binary and other bases (repeated division technique)

* Item 20: How many n bit binary numbers (2^n)
  * a. Using multiplication principle
  * b. Representing bits as elements and numbers as subsets: How many subsets of n element set
  * c. The number of n digit numbers is 1 more than the highest (n-1) digit number
    * Finding the highest n bit number with sum manipulations
    * The highest n bit number is 1 less than the smallest (n+1) bit number = (2^n -1)

* ## Item 21: Geometric Series (sum of a geometric sequence)
  * **SF#6 ( Sum of a geometric sequence / evaluating geometric series )**
  * **SF#7 ( Sum of an infinite geometric sequence / evaluating infinite geometric series )**
  * Technique for evaluating geometric series
    * factor out first term so series starts at 1
    * write each term in the form of r to a power
    * apply SF6 (or SF7 if infinite)

* ## Advanced Sigma Manipulations
  * Item 22: Sigma containing a constant (note: starting at 0 adds an iteration)
* Nested Summations / Double Sigmas: Work on inner sum, then outer sum
  * Item 23: n x n addition table 
  * Item 24: n x n multiplication table 
    * Instead of using sigma manipulations, multiplying 2 sums 
    
* Item 25: Pascal's Triangle
